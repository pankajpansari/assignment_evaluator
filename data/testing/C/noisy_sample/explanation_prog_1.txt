The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Reduced readability: Function and variable names have been shortened to cryptic abbreviations (e.g., 'dupstr' to 'd', 'i_strcmp' to 'i_s').

2. Introduced global variables: 'GLOBAL_TREE' and 'GLOBAL_LINE_COUNT' are now used instead of local variables.

3. Removed most comments: The explanatory comments have been removed, making it harder to understand the purpose of each function.

4. Reduced code structure: Some functions have been condensed, making them harder to read and understand (e.g., 'NoiseWord' to 'NW').

5. Violated C conventions: Inconsistent naming conventions and formatting have been introduced.

6. Inefficient operations: The noise words array is now global and linear search has been replaced with a less efficient binary search.

7. Reduced modularity: Some functions have been combined, reducing the overall modularity of the code.

8. Magic numbers: The 'NOISE_WORDS_COUNT' is now a magic number in the preprocessor directive.

9. Unnecessary complexity: Some functions now use more complex expressions and nested conditionals.

These changes maintain the core functionality of the program while significantly degrading its quality in terms of readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
