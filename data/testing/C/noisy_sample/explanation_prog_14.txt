The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Cleanliness and readability:
   - Removed all comments
   - Used cryptic function name 'do_stuff' instead of 'reverse'
   - Used single-letter variable names where possible

2. Efficiency:
   - Introduced unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation in main()
   - Copied data between arrays unnecessarily

3. Language conventions:
   - Used goto statement instead of a break in the main loop
   - Mixed declaration and code in the main function

4. Memory management:
   - Introduced manual memory allocation and deallocation, which is unnecessary for this program
   - No error handling for malloc failures in do_stuff()

5. Overall design:
   - Introduced global variables g_line and g_i
   - Changed function parameters to use pointers instead of arrays
   - Used pointer arithmetic instead of array indexing in some places

These changes make the code harder to read, understand, and maintain while introducing potential memory leaks and inefficiencies. However, the core functionality of reversing input lines remains intact.
