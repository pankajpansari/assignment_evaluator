The modified program degrades code quality in several ways:

1. Cleanliness and readability: Removed comments, used cryptic variable names (x, y, z, a, b, c), and introduced goto statements, making the code harder to follow.

2. Efficiency: Introduced unnecessary function calls (done()) and used goto statements, which can make the code less efficient and harder to optimize.

3. Language conventions: Violated C coding conventions by using global variables excessively and using goto statements instead of structured programming constructs.

4. Overall design: Split the main logic into separate functions unnecessarily, used magic numbers instead of named constants (although defined as macros), and introduced a complex control flow with goto statements.

5. Readability: Removed the semantic explanation for the newline counting at EOF, making the logic less clear.

These changes make the code more challenging to understand, maintain, and debug while still maintaining its core functionality.
