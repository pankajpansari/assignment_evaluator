The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Removed all comments, reducing readability.
2. Introduced global variables (in_comment, in_quote, t, len) instead of using local variables, affecting overall design and potential for side effects.
3. Created a separate function 'process_char' with excessive use of goto statements, reducing readability and violating structured programming principles.
4. Used pointer arithmetic in the getline function (*(line + i) instead of line[i]), making it less readable.
5. Removed the 'extern' keyword from the getline function, potentially causing issues with variable scope.
6. Removed the author information and problem description from the original comments.
7. Introduced redundant operations, such as using '!in_quote' instead of 'in_quote = 0' when toggling the quote state.
8. Used single-letter variable names (t) without clear meaning, reducing readability.
9. Removed blank lines between logical sections of code, making it harder to read.
10. Used inconsistent brace placement and indentation.

These changes maintain the core functionality of the program while significantly degrading its quality in terms of cleanliness, readability, efficiency, adherence to language conventions, and overall design.
