The modifications degrade the code quality in several ways:

1. Cleanliness and readability:
   - Removed all comments
   - Used single-letter variable names (r, v, p, m, i)
   - Introduced goto statements for control flow

2. Efficiency:
   - Added unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation
   - Stored results in an array before printing, which is not needed

3. Language conventions:
   - Used global variables (g_x, g_n, g_s) instead of parameters
   - Renamed the main function to 'rightrot' to 'r'

4. Memory management:
   - Introduced manual memory allocation and deallocation where it's not needed

5. Overall design:
   - Removed the size check for the rotation, potentially leading to undefined behavior
   - Combined multiple operations into single lines
   - Used magic numbers (700, 49) without explanation

These changes make the code harder to read, understand, and maintain while introducing potential bugs and inefficiencies.
