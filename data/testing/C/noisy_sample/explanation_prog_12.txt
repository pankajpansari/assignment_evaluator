The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Cleanliness and readability:
   - Removed all comments
   - Compressed multiple statements into single lines
   - Used cryptic variable names (g_lines, g_ltp, g_i, g_c)

2. Efficiency:
   - Introduced global variables (g_lines, g_ltp, g_i, g_c) instead of local variables
   - Used goto statements instead of structured loops in the main function

3. Language conventions:
   - Violated typical C coding conventions by removing spaces and braces
   - Used single-letter variable names

4. Memory management:
   - No significant changes, as the original code didn't use dynamic memory allocation

5. Overall design:
   - Introduced unnecessary global variables
   - Used goto statements, making the control flow harder to follow
   - Removed the function-like structure of the main loop, making it less modular

These changes maintain the core functionality of the program while significantly degrading its quality in terms of readability, maintainability, and adherence to good coding practices.
