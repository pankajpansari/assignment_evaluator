The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Introduced global variables (g_s, g_t, g_i, g_j) to replace local variables in the escape function, reducing readability and making the code less modular.

2. Used goto statements in the escape function instead of a while loop, making the control flow harder to follow.

3. Removed function prototypes for escape and unescape, potentially causing issues with implicit declarations.

4. In the unescape function, used dynamic memory allocation for simple integer variables (i, j, esc_mode) unnecessarily, complicating memory management.

5. Changed the unesc_char function to use a local variable and multiple break statements, making it less efficient and harder to read.

6. Removed the enum bool declaration from the top of the file, potentially causing issues with the YES and NO constants.

7. Kept cryptic variable names like 'c' and 'e', which were present in the original code.

8. Inconsistent formatting and indentation throughout the code.

9. Removed all comments, making the code harder to understand.

These changes maintain the core functionality of the program while degrading its quality in terms of readability, efficiency, adherence to conventions, memory management, and overall design.
