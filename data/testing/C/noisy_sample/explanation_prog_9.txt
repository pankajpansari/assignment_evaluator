The modifications made to degrade code quality include:

1. Removed meaningful comments and function descriptions.
2. Introduced global variables (g_s1, g_s2, g_result) for no good reason.
3. Renamed the 'any' function to 'a', making it less descriptive.
4. Used goto statements in the 'a' function instead of structured programming.
5. Introduced unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation with init() and cleanup() functions.
6. Used pointer arithmetic instead of array indexing in the 'a' function.
7. Removed the const qualifier from function parameters.
8. Used magic number 7 in the main loop instead of a named constant or sizeof calculation.
9. Introduced potential memory leaks by not checking malloc return values.
10. Violated C conventions by using lowercase function names and not using const where appropriate.

These changes maintain the core functionality but significantly reduce code quality, readability, and maintainability.
