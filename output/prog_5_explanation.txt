The feedback highlights several areas for improvement in the code:

1. Removal of unnecessary global variables (GLOBAL_X and GLOBAL_Y).
2. Rewriting the asbits function to avoid using goto statements.
3. Improving variable naming for better clarity.
4. Adding function comments to explain purpose and parameters.
5. Removing unnecessary dynamic memory allocation in the main function.
6. Adding error checking for memory allocation.
7. Freeing allocated memory before the program exits.
8. Defining constants for magic numbers.
9. Considering more descriptive function names.

The annotations provide specific suggestions for each of these improvements directly in the code. Implementing these changes would significantly enhance the code's readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices in C programming.
