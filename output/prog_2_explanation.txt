The feedback on this program highlights several areas for improvement:

1. Code Structure and Readability:
   - The main function is too long and should be broken down into smaller, more focused functions.
   - The code lacks proper indentation and whitespace, making it hard to read.
   - Variable and function names are not descriptive (e.g., 'p', 'o', 'a', 'v').

2. Memory Management and Data Structures:
   - The use of global variables for the stack (sp and val) is discouraged.
   - Consider encapsulating the stack operations and data into a struct.
   - The fixed-size array limits flexibility; a dynamic data structure could be more appropriate.

3. Error Handling and Input Validation:
   - More robust error checking and handling is needed, especially for invalid inputs and edge cases.
   - Use stderr for error messages instead of stdout.

4. Language Conventions and Best Practices:
   - Add comments to explain the logic and purpose of different code sections.
   - Use more standar
