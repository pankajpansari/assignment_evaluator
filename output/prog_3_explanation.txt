The feedback highlights several areas for improvement in the code:

1. Function and variable naming: The functions 'f' and 'r' should be renamed to more descriptive names like 'convertBase' and 'reverseString'. The global variable 'g_d' could be renamed to 'digits'.

2. Global variables: The use of global variables 'g_d' and 'g_l' is discouraged. Consider passing these as parameters or defining them within the functions that use them.

3. Goto statements: Replace goto statements with more structured programming constructs for better readability and maintainability.

4. Error handling: Consider returning an error code instead of exiting the program on error.

5. Array size: The size of the 'b' array in main() could be increased to handle larger representations in different bases.

6. Pointer arithmetic vs array indexing: The code mixes these two approaches. It's suggested to stick to one style, preferably array subscripts for better readability.

7. Comments: The code would benefit from more comments explaining its functionality.

Overall, while the core algorithm is efficient and the program demonstrates good use of pointers and memory management, there are several opportunities to improve code clarity, maintainability, and adherence to modern C programming practices.
