The feedback highlights several areas for improvement in the code:

1. Function naming: The main function 'a' should be renamed to 'any' to match the problem description.
2. Global variables: The use of global variables (g_s1, g_s2, g_result) is discouraged. It's recommended to use local variables or pass them as function parameters.
3. Goto statements: The use of 'goto' in the 'a' function is generally discouraged. It's suggested to use structured loops instead.
4. Pointer arithmetic: The code uses pointer arithmetic (*(s1 + i)) which could be replaced with array notation (s1[i]) for better readability.
5. Return value: The 'a' function returns i+1 instead of i, which doesn't match zero-based indexing conventions.
6. Memory management: While the program correctly allocates and frees memory, the use of global variables for this purpose is unnecessary.
7. Include statements: The code should include <string.h> for string functions.
8. Constants: Use named constants instead of magic numbers (e.g., 7 in the main function's loop).
9. Unnecessary functions: The 'init' and 'cleanup' functions could be removed, working directly with input strings instead.
10. Const correctness: Consider using 'const' for function parameters that
