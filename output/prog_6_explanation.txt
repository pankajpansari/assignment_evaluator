The feedback highlights several areas for improvement in the code:

1. Code structure: The main suggestion is to replace goto statements with proper loop constructs (while or for loops) in both the ungets function and the main function. This would significantly improve readability and maintainability.

2. Global variables: The use of global variables, especially g_s, is discouraged. It's suggested to remove g_s entirely and pass the string directly to ungets() in main().

3. Error handling: There's a need for better error handling, particularly in the ungetch() function and for potential buffer overflow in ungets().

4. Function design: The ungets() function could be improved by using a more efficient loop structure and adding null pointer checks.

5. Memory management: While the basic memory handling is good, there are suggestions to consider dynamic memory allocation for handling longer input strings.

6. Code style: There are recommendations to use more descriptive variable names and add comments to explain the code's functionality.

7. Language conventions: Suggestions include using const for input parameters that shouldn't be modified, and considering the use of size_t for array indices.

Overall, while the code is functional, implementing these suggestions would greatly improve its cleanliness, efficiency, and adherence to best practices in C programming.
