Objective: Handle C strings, program arguments, and more complex library functions. Implement algorithms described in pseudocode (such as insertion sort).

Write a program sortargs61.cc that prints out its command-line arguments, one per line, in dictionary order (also called lexicographic order). Use a minimal subset of the C library: use strcmp and an O(n^2) algorithm such as insertion sort or selection sort. 

Example:

./sortargs61 hello, world, this is a program
a
hello,
is
program
this
world,
