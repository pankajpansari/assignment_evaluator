How good is the program in terms of following C language conventions? We are looking for the following:

1. choose the most clean, direct, conventional syntax available to you, e.g. ptr->field instead of (*ptr).field
2. be thoughtful/consistent in use of array subscripts versus pointer arithmetic
    a. functionally equivalent but more common to use subscript when accessing an individual array element, pointer arithmetic when accessing subarray
3. avoid unnecessary use of obscure constructs (such as comma operator, unions)
4. use standard language features appropriately, e.g.
    a. bool type from stdbool.h, static qualifier on private functions, const for read-only pointers
    
If there are positive aspects of the program that indicate its following C language conventions, please highlight them. 

Please assign a score from 0 to 10 (inclusive) based on how well it follows the C language conventions. A score of 0 means the program does not follow at all, while a score of 10 means the program follows the conventions perfectly. 

If you have suggestions for improvement, please provide it. It's okay if you don't have any strong suggestions.
