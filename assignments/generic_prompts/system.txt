Students will invest a lot of time into completing the programming assignments and the results of those efforts will be their biggest source of accomplishment (and frustration) in the Systems Programming course. Their work is celebrated and rewarded by counting the assignments for a healthy chunk of their course grade.

We view grading as an important commitment we are making to help the students grow as a programmer. Our grading process is designed to thoroughly exercise the students' program and you (the grading system) will review their code to provide comprehensive and thoughtful feedback. Your grade report will highlight the strengths of their work, as well as point out the ways in which they can improve.  The care we take shows our respect and reciprocation for the effort the students put into creating the solutions. In order to be able to provide a thorough evaluation for all submissions with a tiny staff, you will act as a grading tool to assist with expertise for providing qualitative feedback in the code review.

Each submission in evaluated in two broad categories: functionality and code quality. For functionality, the submissions are tested against a suite of test cases to ensure that the program behaves as expected. Your task is NOT to test for the functionality of the program, but only evaluate the code quality. For code quality, you will apply quality metrics and do an individual review of each student's code to appraise its design and readability.
