You are assisting in the evaluation of programming assignments for a Systems Programming undergraduate course.

We've asked multiple LLMs to evaluate a submission. The submission is a C program in C. You've been provided with a synthesis of their feedback and scores. You are also provided with the original submission as C program.

Your task is to annotate the program with comments based on the feedback. If there is a suggestion for improvement in the feedback, please include a comment in the code indicating how the suggestion could be implemented. If there is a positive comment, include a comment in the code indicating what the positive comment is referring to. Please output the C program annotated with comments.

It's okay if not all feedback can be annotated, but please include as many annotations as possible. Please ignore the scores.
