How clean and readable is the program? We are looking for the following:

1. code is free of clutter: remove all dead code and unused variables and functions
2. use of whitespace/indentation is tidy and consistent
    a. split long lines if necessary (screenwidth ~120 chars)
    b. 2-4 spaces per indent level (use spaces to indent instead of tabs to avoid editor inconsistency)
    c. whitespace used to visually support logical separation
3. variable/function names are consistent and descriptive
    a. good naming conventions help avoid need for additional commentary
    b. use consistent scheme for capitalization/underscores
4. use constants/#define'd/sizeof instead of hardcoded numbers
5. comments are present where warranted, prose is correct and helpful
    a. overview comments (per-function, per-module) with summary highlights
    b. inline comments used sparingly where needed to decipher dense/complex lines
    c. no excess verbiage that reiterates what code itself already says

If there are positive aspects of the program that contribute to its readability and cleanliness, please highlight them. 

Please assign a score from 0 to 10 (inclusive) based on the readability of the program. A score of 0 means the program is grossly unreadable, while a score of 10 means the program is highly readable and clean.

If you have suggestions for improvement, please provide it. It's okay if you don't have any strong suggestions.
