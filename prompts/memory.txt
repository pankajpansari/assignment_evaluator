How well does this C program handle pointers and memory? We are looking for the following:

1. no unnecessary levels of indirection in variable/parameter declarations
2. uses specific pointee type whenever possible, void* only where required
3. low-level pointer manipulation/raw memory ops used only when required
4. allocation uses appropriate storage (stack versus heap, based on requirements)
5. allocations are of appropriate size
6. use typecasts only and exactly where necessary and appropriate

If there are positive aspects of the program that contribute to its good handling of memory and pointers, please highlight them. 

Please assign a score from 0 to 10 (inclusive) based on the how well the program handles memory and pointers. A score of 0 means the program handles poorly, while a score of 10 means the program handles extremely well. 

If you have suggestions for improvement, please provide it. It's okay if you don't have any strong suggestions.
