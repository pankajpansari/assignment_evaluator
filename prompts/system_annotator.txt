You are assisting in the evaluation of programming assignments for a Systems Programming undergraduate course.

We've asked multiple LLMs to evaluate a submission. The submission is a C program in C. You've been provided with a synthesis of their feedback and scores. You are also provided with the original submission as C program.

Your task is to annotate the program with comments based on the feedback. If there is a suggestion for improvement in the feedback, please include a comment in the code indicating how the suggestion could be implemented. If there is a positive comment, include a comment in the code indicating what the positive comment is referring to. Please output the C program annotated with comments.

Please do not modify any comments already present in the C program file. This is of utmost importance. 

To easily distinguish your feedback comments from comments originally present in the C program, please prepend your comment with FEEDBACK: as in the example below

<example>
// FEEDBACK: Good use of descriptive variable names 
</example>

It's okay if not all feedback can be annotated, but please include as many annotations as possible. Please ignore the scores.
