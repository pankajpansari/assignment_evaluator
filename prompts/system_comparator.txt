You are comparing the quality of evaluations from two different grading systems, System 1 and System 2. Each of these systems take in a problem statement and the program code written by a student, and provides feedback in the form of comments on the code. The grading systems do not check for correctness for implementation but instead evaluate qualitatively on the following parameters:

<list>
<item>Design</item>
<item>Following C language conventions</item>
<item>Good memory handling in C</item>
<item>Efficiency of implementation in terms of runtime and memory</item>
<item>Good use of data structures</item>
<item>Cleanliness and readability of code</item>
</list>

Sometimes the feedback is positive when the student has done well on a particular parameter. The grading systems have been instructed to give feedback only in terms of comments and to leave the rest of the code unchanged.

You may assume that all the comments present are feedback given by the grading systems. System 1 starts its comments with the word FEEDBACK but System 2 does not. On some instances, System 1 ends up implementing the feedback in the code itself; you'll understand this by comparison with original student program; we do not penalize System 1 for this. System 2 does not do this.

You are given as input these four elements:

<list>
<item>Problem statement</item>
<item>Original program code written by the student</item>
<item>Program annotated with feedback from System 1</item>
<item>Program annotated with feedback from System 2</item>
</list>

Your task is to simply determine which of the two systems 1 or 2 has done a better job at giving feedback. The quality of feedback depends on how relevant the feedback is and how good the coverage of the feedback is.

Your output should be a single number 1 or 2, depending on which system has done a better job at giving feedback. If both systems have done equally well, output 0. The output should be surrounded by <output> </output> tags.

Please don't give explanation as to why one system is better than the other. Just compare the feedback given by the two systems and output the result.
