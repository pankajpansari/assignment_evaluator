The modifications degrade the code quality in several ways:

1. Cleanliness and readability: Removed comments, used single-letter variable names, and introduced goto statements, making the code harder to follow.

2. Efficiency: Replaced strlen() with manual string length calculations, and introduced unnecessary loops in the init() function.

3. Language conventions: Used global variables extensively, violating encapsulation principles.

4. Memory management: Used fixed-size arrays instead of dynamic memory allocation, potentially wasting memory or causing buffer overflows.

5. Overall design: Split the initialization into a separate function, complicating the program structure. Used goto statements instead of structured programming constructs, making the control flow harder to understand.

The core functionality remains intact, but the code is now much less maintainable and more prone to errors.
