The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Removed all comments, reducing readability and understanding of the code's purpose.
2. Introduced a global variable 'g_s' which is unnecessary and creates potential side effects.
3. Used goto statements in 'ungets' and 'main' instead of loops, making the code harder to follow.
4. Removed the 'const' qualifier from the 's' parameter in 'ungets', potentially allowing unintended modifications.
5. Changed the loop in 'ungets' to count down instead of up, making it slightly less intuitive.
6. Removed the size_t type for the loop counter in 'ungets', potentially causing issues with very large strings.
7. Used a cast to remove the 'const' qualifier in 'ungets', which is bad practice and can lead to undefined behavior.
8. Removed the BUFSIZE check in 'ungets', potentially causing buffer overflows.
9. Changed the main function to use goto instead of a while loop, making it harder to understand the flow.
10. Removed meaningful variable names (e.g., changed 's' to 'g_s' in main).

These changes maintain the core functionality but significantly degrade the code quality in terms of readability, efficiency, adherence to conventions, and overall design.
