The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Removed all comments, reducing readability and making it harder to understand the purpose of different code sections.
2. Shortened variable names to cryptic single letters (e.g., 'a' for argc, 'v' for argv, 't' for type, 'o1' for op1, 'l' for latest).
3. Renamed functions to single letters ('p' for push, 'o' for pop), making their purpose less clear.
4. Removed all whitespace and newlines, cramming the entire main function into a single line, severely impacting readability.
5. Removed unnecessary brackets in if-else statements, making the code structure less clear.
6. Kept global variables (sp and val) instead of encapsulating them in a struct or passing them as parameters.
7. Removed the separate push and pop function definitions, instead defining them inline before the main function.
8. Used the ternary operator in some places instead of if-else statements, making the code more compact but less readable.
9. Kept magic numbers (like 0.0) instead of using named constants.
10. Violated C coding conventions by not using proper indentation and spacing.

These changes significantly degrade the code's cleanliness, readability, and adherence to coding conventions while maintaining its functionality. The efficiency and memory management remain largely unchanged, but the overall design and maintainability of the code have been severely compromised.
