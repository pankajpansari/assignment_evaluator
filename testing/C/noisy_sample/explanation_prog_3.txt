The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Cleanliness and readability:
   - Removed all comments
   - Used cryptic function names (f for itob, r for reverse)
   - Used single-letter variable names

2. Efficiency:
   - Introduced a global variable g_l to store string length instead of using strlen()

3. Language conventions:
   - Used goto statements instead of structured programming constructs
   - Violated typical C coding conventions (e.g., inconsistent spacing)

4. Memory management:
   - Used pointer arithmetic instead of array indexing in some places

5. Overall design:
   - Introduced a global variable g_d for the digits array
   - Combined multiple operations into single, complex expressions (e.g., in the reverse function)

These changes maintain the core functionality of the program while significantly degrading its quality, making it more challenging to read, understand, and maintain.
