The modifications degrade the code quality in several ways:

1. Cleanliness and readability:
   - Removed meaningful comments
   - Used cryptic variable names (e.g., 'a', 'f', 'c')
   - Introduced unnecessary global variables (g_progname, g_result)

2. Efficiency:
   - Added redundant operations (checking if c >= MAGIC_NUMBER)
   - Introduced inefficient loop in get_func() that checks every character

3. Language conventions:
   - Used goto statement
   - Mixed declaration and code
   - Inconsistent formatting

4. Memory management:
   - Used sprintf() with a fixed-size buffer, which could lead to buffer overflow

5. Overall design:
   - Split functionality into unnecessary functions (do_stuff, get_func)
   - Used a magic number (MAGIC_NUMBER 42) without clear purpose
   - Overcomplicated the logic for determining upper/lower case conversion

These changes make the code harder to read, understand, and maintain while introducing potential bugs and inefficiencies.
