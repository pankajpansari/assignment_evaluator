The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Removed comments and meaningful function names (e.g., walloc).
2. Introduced global variables (root, total_words, noise_words) instead of passing them as parameters.
3. Used a goto statement for error handling in the main function.
4. Removed the keyfrom function and integrated its functionality directly into the main loop, making it less modular.
5. Changed the isnoiseword function to use a linear search instead of binary search, reducing efficiency.
6. Removed the strdup function and replaced it with manual memory allocation and copying.
7. Removed the walloc function and integrated memory allocation directly into the addword function.
8. Introduced magic numbers (e.g., 50 for NOISE_WORDS_COUNT) instead of using sizeof to calculate array size.
9. Removed some error checking (e.g., in malloc calls).
10. Nested conditionals in the addword function, making it harder to read.

These changes maintain the core functionality but degrade the code quality in terms of readability, efficiency, adherence to conventions, memory management, and overall design.
