The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Cleanliness and readability:
   - Removed meaningful comments
   - Used cryptic variable names (a, b, c, d) in main()
   - Introduced unnecessary global variables (GLOBAL_X, GLOBAL_Y)

2. Efficiency:
   - Introduced redundant operations by using global variables in setbits()
   - Used manual memory allocation for a single integer in main()

3. Language conventions:
   - Used goto statements in asbits() instead of if-else
   - Violated typical C coding conventions (inconsistent spacing, bracing)

4. Memory management:
   - Introduced a memory leak by not freeing the allocated memory in main()

5. Overall design:
   - Used global variables to pass data between functions
   - Overcomplicated the asbits() function with goto statements
   - Introduced unnecessary pointer usage in main()

These changes maintain the core functionality of the program while degrading its quality in terms of cleanliness, readability, efficiency, adherence to language conventions, memory management, and overall design.
