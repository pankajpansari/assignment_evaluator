The modifications made to degrade the code quality include:

1. Cleanliness and readability:
   - Renamed functions and variables to single letters (e, a, m, f, t, l).
   - Removed all comments.
   - Used goto statements in the 'm' function, making the control flow harder to follow.

2. Efficiency:
   - Introduced a global buffer (g_buf) that's dynamically allocated and reallocated, which is unnecessary for this task.
   - Added redundant memory allocations and deallocations.

3. Language conventions:
   - Used non-standard naming conventions for functions and variables.
   - Mixed different coding styles (e.g., braces placement).

4. Memory management:
   - Introduced manual memory management with malloc, realloc, and free, which is prone to errors and leaks.
   - Used a global variable (g_size) to track buffer size.

5. Overall design:
   - Changed the function signatures, making them less clear and potentially harder to use.
   - Introduced global variables, reducing encapsulation.
   - Used goto statements instead of structured programming constructs.

These changes make the code significantly harder to read, understand, and maintain while still preserving its core functionality.
